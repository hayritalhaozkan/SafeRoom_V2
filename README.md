##  Zoom vs. SafeRoom_V2

| Feature / Claim            | Zoom                                                       | 🚀 SafeRoom_V2                                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **"End-to-End Encryption"**| Decrypted on server for routing purposes                   | True E2EE – AES keys are exchanged via RSA and kept in RAM  |
| **Performance**            | CPU-heavy during meetings, especially on weak systems       | RAM-based, optimized encryption and compression pipeline     |
| **Data Persistence**       | May store metadata, relays through cloud infrastructure      | Ephemeral by design — no disk logs, no database footprints   |
| **Security Philosophy**    | Centralized — Trust the server                              | Decentralized — Trust the protocol, not the infrastructure   |
| **Privacy Guarantee**      | Conditional, policy-based                                   | Absolute — No content touches server memory                  |
| **Tech Stack**             | Web-heavy, browser-centric                                  | Native Java + Custom Protocol + Memory-first engine          |
| **Control Over System**    | Limited (closed source, hardcoded configs)                  | Full — You own the code, the protocol, the infrastructure    |

## 🔓 Why SafeRoom_V2 Exists

Because security is not a checkbox, it's a principle.

SafeRoom_V2 was built from scratch with one mindset:
> **If you don’t own your communication stack, someone else does.**

We don’t patch privacy leaks. We don’t ask you to "trust us".  
We simply **engineer systems that don’t need trust** in the first place.

## 🧠 TL;DR Philosophy

> Zoom gives you features.  
> We give you **control**.  
> Zoom gives you convenience.  
> We give you **freedom**.  
> Zoom lets you talk.  
> SafeRoom lets you **disappear after you talk**.

## 🚧 Still in active development

SafeRoom_V2 is not just a Zoom alternative. It's a **new conversation protocol** in disguise.
